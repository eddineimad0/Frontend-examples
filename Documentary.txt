Front end project Documentary
-----------------------------------
in this project i will be trying to recreate a bunch of website using javascript,css,html

What i learned  a 

## 1. Creative design

in term of html markup using section to divide the website is a smart aproch to designing

in css you can import fonts directly and i also learnt some extra function and tricks

* using viewport width and height is usefull when designing something that should react to user device
* the *{} can be used in start to remove margin and padding make box-sizing=border box remove text-decoration and set the default font family and weight
* position of absolute is great for centering header element such as main title and top page stuff
* as usuall flex box works wonder with nav items and :: before and ::after are great for adding decorative stuff to element
* the transition property is used to transition one or all properties through states
* left 50% and translateX(-50%) for centering elements
* transition property choose which proprety is animated for how much time
* multilevel shadows with negative and positive values


## look up position absolute and first last child and text align justify , object fit , text indent

## defining a section by 100% width and 100vh a transiton of smooth

## 2. Architect

*an image-wrapper is useful for adding a blackshade to the image
*setting html font-size to 62.5% makes rem= 10px
*outline and border are kinda similar
* animation can have an time offset for it to wait useful when two or more items have the same animation
*display none or opacity 0 and visibility hidden
*attr("attribute name ")
* for somme reason gridbox and 100vh cause
* padding is good for sectioning 
* display grid and grid-template-column:repeat(number of columns ,width or fraction)
*grid-gap for distancing grid element
*grid element can be positioned by grid-column and grid-row property
:nth child
